Support Vector Regression (SVR) is similar to Support Vector machine (SVM). But SVM is used to predict discrete class labels and SVM is used to predict continuous class labels.

Support Vector regression can be used for both linear and non linear regressions. Epsilon is the distance around the hyperplanes. The points inside the epsilon are considered as correct predictions. So epsilon can be tuned to increase the performance.
Slack is the distance above upper hyperplane and below lower hyperplane, till which the regression errors allows the points to exist. But it satisfies all required conditions.
